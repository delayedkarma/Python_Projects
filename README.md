### Some programming projects that I have been working on in my spare time


* Tic-Tac-Toe (Basic) -- I have created a very simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe. I would develop this more, but I want to create a more advanced version using PyGame. 

* How to Make a Dadaist Poem (Version 1) - I've been thinking about Tristan Tzara's 'How to Make a Dadaist Poem' (https://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88v/tzara.html) and the nature of the process struck me as fairly algorithmic. So I figured trying to code it in Python would be a natural step. I used the standard texts included with the NLTK toolkit in Python, and for Version 1, used 3 of the texts. I plan to extend this for different sorts of texts, and extend the code to include a Sentiment Analysis as well. 

* Filming Locations of Anthony Bourdain shows in the US - Using the following dataset (https://data.world/makeovermonday/2018w33-anthony-bourdains-travels) I have created a map of the filming locations in the USA of all 4 of Anthony Bourdain's TV shows using Basemap in Python. Will keep refining it over time.
